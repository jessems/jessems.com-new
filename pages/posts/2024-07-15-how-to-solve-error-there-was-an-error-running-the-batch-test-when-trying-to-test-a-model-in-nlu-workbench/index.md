When you try to run a test on your model using test utterances in NLU Workench you might run into the following error message:

```text
There was an error running the batch test.
```

It may be due to the `sys_properties` record `glide.shared_service_scheduler.url` not being set. Setting it to `https://sncmlscheduler.service-now.com/` might resolve it.
