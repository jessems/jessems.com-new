You can solve this as follows:

<Steps>

### Navigate to the `asmt_metric_definition` table and filter by package

Navigate to the `asmt_metric_definition` table (`/asmt_metric_definition` with SN Utils).

Set up a filter to filter for the Package `Virtual Agent Topic Blocks`.

### Change your session language to the target language

The previous step will only display the records that correspond to your current session language. To edit the records from other languages, change your session language (`/lang <language code>` with SN Utils, or via the user preferences).
