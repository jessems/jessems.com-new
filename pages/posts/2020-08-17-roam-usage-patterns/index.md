## Using daily pages as versioning for other entity types

### Problem

You want to keep a historical record of something, but adding a date entry to an entity can be tedious and needs to be replicated for all entities.

### Solution

If you list your goals in your daily page under a reference like `[[Goals]]`, when you visit the `[[Goals]]` page you will see a historical record of your stated goals in linked references section. There will be one for each day.

## Using your graph overview as an entry point

### Problem

You want to share your Roam database with others but a Page may not provide enough context to serve as an entry point.

### Solution

Tommy Collison shares a link to his graph overview of his great books project. This is user friendly way of sharing your database.
