# KAMAS ("CP/M"/DOS, 1984-1993)

# ECCO Pro (Windows, 1993-1997)

Ecco Pro was a personal information manager software based on an outliner, and supporting folders similar to spreadsheet columns that allow filtering and sorting of information based upon user defined criteria. It was seen to have an easier learning curve than GrandView. At the same time, its novel and complicated mix of features may have prevented it from gaining mainstream adoption.
