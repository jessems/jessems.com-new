Modern personal knowledge management tools like [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) are amazing. They've changed my workflow so much and I couldn't imagine a life without them anymore.

One aspect that still seems underdeveloped though is publishing a web of networked thoughts. These are sometimes also referred to as "Digital Gardens". Some notable ones include [Andy Matuschak's notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) and [Maggie Appletons Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden).

In most cases these people have created a custom solution. I've tried that, but it's a big time commitment.

Recently a friend of mine, [@nosilverv](https://twitter.com/nosilverv) on Twitter, published a glossary of his mental models in a Google doc. He asked his Twitter friends if someone could help him convert it into a Digital Garden of sorts.

I felt inspired to try a combination I thought might have potential: Obsidian + [Blot.im](https://blot.im/).

Obsidian is a markdown-based tool for networked thought. It's not outliner based, like Roam and Logseq. Instead it's file based, which makes is very suitable for web publishing. I used Obsidian to organize the thoughts into different files, make sure the links between the worked and navigate the graph view.

Then I put the vault in a folder which got synced to Blot.im, which turns it into a nice, simple blog which is interlinked in a pleasant way. The result is a Digital Garden with minimal set up. The only cost is Blot ($4/month).
