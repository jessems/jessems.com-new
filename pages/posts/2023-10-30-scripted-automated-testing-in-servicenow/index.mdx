This is a collection of tips for automated programmatic testing in ServiceNow.

## Add a comment which includes the name of the file to make your tests searchable

Server Side ATF Scripts don't have descriptive names in the platform. When they sync to your local machine through sn-script-sync, they show up as `sys_atf_step` records with names like `RunServerSideScript-1771.variable-script`. To make them easier to find, I add a comment on the first line with the name of the file. Then at least I can find them using CMD/CTRL + SHIFT + F in VS Code.

```js filename="RunServerSideScript-1771.variable-script"
// ScriptIncludeName

describe('ScriptIncludeName tests', function () {
	it('should do something', function () {
		// test code
	});
});
```

## Using fit to focus on certain test cases

## Define a variable outside of the describe block, so that you can set it in a `beforeAll` or `beforeEach` block and access it in an `it` block

## Make sure you use getValue

## Use toBe() so you can add the second argument

## Put Test Steps of different scopes in dedicated suites

There's an error I've run into when I try to include test steps of different scopes in a single globally scoped test suite. It complains that it doesn't recognize the jasmine methods such as `describe`:

```text
JavaException: java.lang.SecurityException: describe undefined, maybe missing global qualifier
```

You can solve this by putting the test steps of different scopes in separate suites. You can then still encapsulate all of them in a globally scoped suite.

import { FileTree } from 'nextra/components'
 
<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="Parent Suite (Global)" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="Child Suite (Scope #1)" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="Test (Scope #1)" />
	</FileTree.Folder>
	<FileTree.Folder name="Child Suite (Scope #2)" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="Test (Scope #2)" />
	</FileTree.Folder>
	<FileTree.Folder name="Child Suite (Global)" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="Test (Global)" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## How to test data broker scripts

```js
		beforeAll(function () {
			var GET_SERVER_DATA_DATA_BROKER = 'bd855e8487daf910cc53a8290cbb3547';
			var grDataBroker = new GlideRecord('sys_ux_data_broker_transform');
			grDataBroker.get(GET_SERVER_DATA_DATA_BROKER);
			var gse = new GlideScopedEvaluator();
			gse.evaluateScript(grDataBroker, 'script');
	});
```

## How to use a delay/sleep in programmatic tests

Servicenow has some guidance [here](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1737777).

```js
(function(outputs, steps, params, stepResult, assertEqual) {

    // add test script here

    var counter = 0;

    var timeout = 560; // this is set to 9 minutes. You can change the time according to your requirement. Time is in seconds.

    while (counter <= timeout){

        counter++;

        sn_atf.AutomatedTestingFramework.waitOneSecond();

    }

})(outputs, steps, params, stepResult, assertEqual);
```
