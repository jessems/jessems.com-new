Sometimes as a ServiceNow developer you perform some kind of action in your code which triggers a Business Rule (or another asynchronous process) and you want to wait around for the result.

How do you do this? 

ServiceNow's JavaScript engine, Rhino, doesn't support `setTimeout` and it runs on ES5 so it doesn't support Promises or async/await.

There's `gs.sleep()` which is an out-of-the-box method which blocks the current execution context, but it doesn't work in global scope.

You can write your own sleep / wait function using something like this:

```js
var waitForSeconds = 10;
var endSleep = new GlideDateTime().getNumericValue() + waitForSeconds * 1000;
while (new GlideDateTime().getNumericValue() < endSleep) {
    // intentionally wait
}
```

If you want to also check for a condition, you can do something like this:

```js
var waitForCondition = function (func, timeout) {
	var startTime = new GlideDateTime().getNumericValue();
	var endTime = startTime + timeout * 1000; // convert timeout to milliseconds

	while (new GlideDateTime().getNumericValue() < endTime) {
		var result = func();

		// If the condition is met, we're done!
		if (result) {
			return true;
		}

		// Sleep for 1 second before checking again
		var endSleep = new GlideDateTime().getNumericValue() + 1000;
		while (new GlideDateTime().getNumericValue() < endSleep) {
			// intentionally wait
		}
	}

	// Condition not met within timeout
	return false;
};
```
This function takes in a condition function, which evaluates a condition, as well as a timeout in seconds. It will check the condition every second until the condition is met or the timeout is reached.

And you can use it as follows:

```js
var openIncidentsExist = function () {
    var grIncident = new GlideRecord('incident');
    grIncident.addQuery('status', '1');
    grIncident.query();

    return grIncident.hasNext();
};

waitForCondition(checkForOpenIncidents, 10);
// Returns false if no open incidents exist after 10 seconds
// Returns true if open incidents exist within 10 seconds
```
