After you've exported an update set to XML, you can import it as follows:

1. Navigate to **System Update Sets > Retrieved Update Sets**
2. Click on the Related Link "Import Update Set from XML"

## Continuing work on an exported update set

This [isn't possible](https://www.servicenow.com/community/developer-forum/re-importing-xml-update-sets-and-continuing-to-work-in-them/m-p/2232156). All you can do is import the update set, preview it and commit it. Then continue work in a new update set.
