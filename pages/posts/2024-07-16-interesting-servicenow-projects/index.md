Occasionally I come across interesting projects built around the ServiceNow platform. Some are ServiceNow scripts, others are browser extensions, and some even fall outside of those categories. Here are a few that I've found worth remembering:

### [sysproperties.do](sysproperties.do)

A website that lists all of the ServiceNow `sys_properties` with AI-generated descriptions based on the official documentation.

### [SN TypeScript Util](https://github.com/stevengregory/sn-typescript-util)

> A TypeScript CLI utility that works on-top of the ServiceNow Extension for VS Code. This tool activates a TypeScript-based workflow for ServiceNow developers using VS Code.

I've not tried this myself, but it looks interesting
