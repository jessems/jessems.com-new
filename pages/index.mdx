Hi 👋,

My name is Jesse.

I'm interested in understanding how the world works. Both natural as well as human systems.

Currently, I'm most interested in the meta-question:

How should we be making sense of the world collectively?

Some very smart people are arguing that our ability to do so has been severely compromised by increased interconnectedness and algorithmic content feeds.

I'm also a designer, developer and workshop facilitator.

You can get in touch via jessems that-email-symbol gmail dot com.
